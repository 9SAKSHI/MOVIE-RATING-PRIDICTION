ABSTRACT:

Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore dataanalysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.
The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users .
